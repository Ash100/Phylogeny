On the other hand, we know that positions on the interior of a protein evolve more slowly that surface residues, therefore substitutions have **varying rates** depending on the position of these residues. In the case of variation, modeling these varying rates is computationally consuming, thus a well-behaved, mathematically tractable **gamma distribution** is used for modeling these rate variations."
